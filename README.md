# Studentbox

Studentbox is a project for my 4th year in college. Please visit [the documentation](https://sinux-l5d.github.io/studentbox-doc) which serve as a reflexion for the project, and for research.

The documentation is using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for rendering `content` folder, which is a [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md) vault.
