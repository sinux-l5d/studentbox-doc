My name is Simon LEONARD. This project has been produced during my 4th year after secondary school/_Lyc√©e_. 

Why am I not writing BSc Hons? And why do I use the French word _Lyc√©e_?

Because I'm currently a French student, and I'm in a Erasmus+ exchange year in [Dundalk Institute of Technologies](https://www.dkit.ie/) at the time of writing.\
At DkIT I'm following the course _Computing in Cloud Computing_, meanwhile at [Universit√© Savoie Mont-Blanc](https://univ-smb.fr/en) I'm enrolled in the [CMI programme](https://reseau-figure.fr/about-cmi/?lang=en) for IT, which is basically a bundle of BSc + BSc (hons) + MSc + additional courses on 5 years.
