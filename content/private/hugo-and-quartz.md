# Front matter

Front matter is a YAML[^yaml] header required by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) that should be placed at the very top of every file. The most commons are included in the template (`templates/page`).

For a detailed list of key/values see [this link](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).
