# Research üîé

This section treats about everything that needs to be researched before starting to code.

## API 

Compare API types, knowing I want to transfer files, and need live-capabilities.

### JSON

See [[research/api/json|JSON]]

<!-- ![JSON](research/api/json) -->

### REST 

See [[research/api/rest|REST]].


### GraphQL

See [[research/api/graphql|GraphQL]].

### gRPC & Protobuf

See [[research/api/protobuf|Protobuf]] and [[research/api/grpc|gRPC]].

## Sand-boxing processes 

It's important that each project is isolated from others and eventually from the host. I need a lightweight system that allow to easily add/remove new project, limiting disk/CPU/memory usage.

### Container approach

#### Docker

#### Podman

#### Kubernetes

See implementations and API

### Virtual Machines approach

#### Vagrant

#### Self-managed

#### AWS-managed

## Programming language 

## Storage

The app will 2 different types of data: metadata (users, permissions) and the projects themselves (files).
What type of database? Why?

### Users, permissions, projects...

### Projects

## Logic

### Defining permissions

### Recipe for minimal deploy

All student in mind, write down the simplest way for a user to deploy his php/node.js app.
