# Research 

This section treats about everything that needs to be researched before starting to code.

## API

Compare API types, knowing I want to transfer files, and need live-capabilities.

### REST & JSON

### GraphQL & JSON

### gRPC & Protobuf

## Storage

The app will 2 different types of data: metadata (users, permissions) and the projects themselves (files).

### Users, permissions

### Projects


## Sand-boxing processes 

It's important that each project is isolated from others and eventually from the host. I need a lightweight system that allow to easily add/remove new project, limiting disk/CPU/memory usage.

### Container approach

#### Docker

#### Podman

#### Kubernetes

See implementations and API

### Virtual Machines approach

#### Vagrant

#### Self-managed

#### AWS-managed
