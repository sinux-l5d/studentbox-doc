Add first "runtime", which is a set of container to run a certain type of project. First one is a LAMP (apache php mysql).

I'm also working on how to build containers with github workflow.
This is a challenge because usually 1 repo = 1 container image (with variants based on label). 
I don't want to build every runtime each time a new version is released, so I check for files changed since previous tag. If something has changed in `containerfiles/`, build only the runtime which has changed. 
Also challenging because no for loop exist, I have to use `strategy.matrix`.
Finally, I haven't checked yet if ghcr.io allow to used non-repository based packages. My repo is as github.com/sinux-l5d/studentbox, which means I can have a package at ghcr.io/sinux-ld5/studentbox, but I don't know if I can create a package ghcr.io/sinux-ld5/studentbox-lamp-apache and so on. If not, I will have to either use labels (improper use) or use external registry (quay.io or docker.io)
