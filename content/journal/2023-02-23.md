I just made progress: Apache and PHP container talked to each other inside of a pod.
Also, I statically compiled my app thanks to https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12548#issuecomment-989053364.
The Podman bindings actually don't require a lot of things from its libraries, so adding tags when compiling (like `remote` and others) remove the need for any external C dependencies, and so I can deactivate CGO, and build my final stage from `scratch`.

My final container is 35 MB. I reduced it to 15.5 MB with `upx --lzma`.

I'm now writing a script for conventional commits.
