Started coding. I have a library that list containers owned by my app (using containers labels) and run a new one (dummy, busybox for now).
The client is for now a basic CLI for development.

I'm trying to compile with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, but it don't work.

Moreover, from [Podman's Makefile](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/5865159766d56229899432cb1a72949d171e860c/Makefile#L161):

So I will keep the CGO, but that means shared library (.so) files has to be present
