Today I'm implementing the EnvVar modifiers I've been writing last time.
It works, my MariaDB container now has a default user, default database, and generate a password (`:password` modifier) for both root and user.
For now, the environment variables submitted by the user are written _in all containers_. That require some more CLI design to bound it to a container only, more time than I have.

But now that my runtime is up, I realised I've forgot to expose a port in container. Yet another problem...
Fortunately, I already have a EXPOSE line in a containerfile, and Podman can find a free port by itself, so it should be fairly easy.

I think I won't have time to implement the web-server. Instead, a teacher would have to use the CLI from the server that host containers to create student and projects. The teacher would then need to setup a SFTP server for the student to upload his code.
