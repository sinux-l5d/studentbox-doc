Today I'm working on installing v0.2.0 of Studentbox on a Debian 11 instance. First surprise: I've been building my app for Podman 4, but Debian 11's repository is at Podman 3. That's a issue because it requires more work to get podman installed.
I used the Method 1, Option 2 to upgrade to podman 4: https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-podman-on-debian/

I just discovered Podman as a `--remote` flag, that means it can potentially solve the overthinking problem I have with paths: https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/remote_client.md
