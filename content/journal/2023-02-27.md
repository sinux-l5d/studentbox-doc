I've managed to set up a workflow to build runtime pods (so a set of containerfile) in a test repository. It build and publish to the ghcr.io registry.

I managed to have my runtime containers building, and being published to ghcr.io on each new tag (so a version).

I'm now encountering an issue: when a container is runned, its file might not belong to the host's user, resulting in file I can't read/write/delete.
I should read https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-root-inside-and-outside-container tomorrow for further details.
