I've found a simple solution for my problem the other day: I'm publishing port 80 for the _pod_, so we just need one container listening to port 80 within the pod. 
Because Apache (for the LAMP runtime) is already listening to this port, it shouldn't be a problem.

It's working! with `studentbox spawn -u sinux -p firstproject -r lamp`, it creates a directory in `./data/sinux/firstproject/` for my project, containing my two mountpoints: `db` for MariaDB data, and `html` for my php code. I used my example, changing the values for the connection to the database (for now, I retrieve the password and port with `podman inspect`), and my example works:

```
$ curl http://localhost:38231 -v 
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:38231...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 38231 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:38231
> User-Agent: curl/8.0.1
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
