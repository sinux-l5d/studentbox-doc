Still on Podman API.
Podman don't work like docker: the command line directly take care of the operations, whereas the in docker the command line "translate" the command in a API call to the Docker Engine through unix socket.

In order to spawn containers from the host, I can use either the lib of podman (written in go) or start the daemon REST API and use the bindings.
Why would I use the later option, as it's basically the same as docker? Because the daemon starts with the user's privilege, so in rootless by default.
But if my program is in a container, it can only use the REST API. And so, I need to mount the socket file as a volume.

Let's say I'm using the second approach (simpler for admin). An blog post was written in 2020 about this: https://podman.io/blogs/2020/08/10/podman-go-bindings.html.

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Podman says that podman require fuse-overlayfs to run in rootless.

Podman doesn't have any registry by default, so `podman pull httpd` wouldn't work. It's the job of the admin to first pull my container, but **the Manager should use a absolute path to pull and run containers**.
from /etc/containers/registries.conf:

> We recommend always using fully qualified image names including the registry server (full dns name), namespace, image name, and tag (e.g., registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest) [...]
> When using short names, there is always an inherent risk that the image being pulled could be spoofed.

> When trying to pull the hello-world image, I discovered that docker's container like https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world have the full name docker.io/library/hello-world

I've been using the v2 lib of podman for a few hours before noticing latest is v4...
