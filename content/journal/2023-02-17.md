I had a problem this morning: each container will have a different name, and therefore it won't be possible for a proxy container to know at build time other containers name. So I could not use `ProxyPassMatch ... fastcgi://php-fpm:9000` in my Apache config (php-fpm would be resolve as the real container ip address)

However, within a pod it seams like every container has the same localhost, and therefor I can use something like `ProxyPassMatch fastcgo://127.0.0.1:9000`. I discovered that by creating a pod and running a container inside, then `cat /etc/host` which revealed that the containers' hostname were mapped to 127.0.0.1.

> podman run --rm --pod nc-test --name alp1 docker.io/library/alpine:latest nc -l -p 2589
> podman run --rm --pod nc-test --name alp2 docker.io/library/alpin  
e:latest sh -c 'echo "hello world" | nc alp1 2589'
> ```

> podman run --rm --pod nc-test --name alp1 docker.io/library/alpin  
e:latest nc -l -p 2589
> podman run --rm --pod nc-test --name alp2 docker.io/library/alpin  
e:latest sh -c 'echo "hello world" | nc 127.0.0.1 2589'
> ```

> It shows `hello world` too!
