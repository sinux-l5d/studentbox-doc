Continuing yesterday's work of refactoring to use pods. It's been tough to find how to store the configuration for pods, as some config can be per image or shared between images. I've used a combination of labels, and scripts to generate a list of available config (internal/runtimes) with go generate.
Now I should be able to finish the pod spawning.

I can now spawn Busybox with a specially crafted runtimes.Runtime.

Now I have an issue with a real example (lamp runtime) when pulling an image: I get a 403 error from ghcr.io. I think it's because my computer's config for /etc/containers/registries.conf don't include ghcr.io.
Wrong lead: just a bad URL... Working now.

I must have failed something, my data directory looks like this:
```
data/
├── sb-sinux-php-test-apache/
│  └── html/
├── sb-sinux-php-test-mysql/
│  └── db/
└── sb-sinux-php-test-php/
   └── html/
```

instead of this:
```
data/
├── sb-sinux-php-test
│  ├── html/
│  └── db/
```

That's actually because I create directories by container name, not project.
But let's call it a day, it spawns my pod:
```
➜ podman ps -a --pod
