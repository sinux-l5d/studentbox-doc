Today I start experimenting with the Podman API through its library in Go. I'm not trying Docker API, because I know I want rootless for security measures (thought it's doable, but wasn't so easy last time I checked). I'll have to dig into https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/ to be sure.

The first issue when trying Podman for the first time is that it requires to have multiple uids/gids set for a user in order to use the [rootless mode](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman.1.html#rootless-mode).
So:
```bash
sudo usermod --add-subuids 10000-75535 $(whoami)
sudo usermod --add-subgids 10000-75535 $(whoami)
```

Now, `podman images list` should run.
