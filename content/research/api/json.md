It's a serialisation format that is human-friendly, meaning object, arrays and values are represented in a string. Example:

```js
{
	"name": "Simon",
	"surname": "Leonard",
	"age": 21,
	"hobbies": [
		"cooking",
		"reading",
		"drinking coffee"
	],
	"enemies": null
}
```

Here is a speculative object that could represent me in JSON.
