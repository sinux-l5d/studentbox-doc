It's a serialisation format that is human-friendly, meaning objects, arrays and values are represented in a string. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Simon",
  "surname": "Leonard",
  "age": 21,
  "hobbies": ["cooking", "reading", "drinking coffee"],
  "enemies": null
}
```

Here is a speculative object that could represent me in JSON.

This time, let's say I have a array of users:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "12345",
      "name": "Simon",
      "surname": "Leonard",
      "age": 21,
      "hobbies": ["cooking", "reading", "drinking coffee"],
      "allies": ["54321"]
    },
    {
      "id": "54321",
      "name": "Lucas",
      "surname": "Thomas",
      "age": 22,
      "hobbies": [],
      "allies": ["12345"]
    }
  ]
}
```

We can see that JSON has at least one drawback: the document's structure and the data are mixed. You can see above that we repeat the keys `id`, `name`, `surname`... for multiple users.
