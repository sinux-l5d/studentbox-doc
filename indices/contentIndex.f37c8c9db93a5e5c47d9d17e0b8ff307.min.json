This project has been produced during my 4th year after secondary school/_Lyc√©e_. \n\nWhy am I not writing BSc Hons? And why do I use the French word _Lyc√©e_?\n\nBecause I'm currently a French student, and I'm in a Erasmus+ exchange year in [Dundalk Institute of Technologies](https://www.dkit.ie/) at the time of writing.\\\nAt DkIT I'm following the course _Computing in Cloud Computing_, meanwhile at [Universit√© Savoie Mont-Blanc](https://univ-smb.fr/en) I'm enrolled in the [CMI programme](https://reseau-figure.fr/about-cmi/?lang=en) for IT, which is basically a bundle of BSc + BSc (hons) + MSc + additional courses on 5 years.\n\nSee my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/simon-l5d) and [Github](https://github.com/sinux-l5d).","lastmodified":"2023-01-09T18:21:30.356464212Z","tags":null},"/project/goals":{"title":"Goals üéØ","content":"\n# Back end\n\nThe back end should be either hosted on AWS or an on-premise server.\n\nAmazon's cloud would be useful if one needs to easily scale as more students use it.\nOn another hand, an on-premise server allow flexibility and complete control other data, privacy and hosting.\n\nThis means that I cannot use AWS's specific service, or at least not without increasing development cost.\n\nFinally, an easy/automated installation would save time.\n\n## Isolate process\n\nWe don't want that students' project impact other's by accident or on purpose.\n\nIf a web app crash, is heavily dealing with I/O, or is stuck in a infinite loop, it should impact as little as possible other projects.\n\n## Data exchange\n\nThe API should be bidirectional, for let's say uploading files and getting live logs of the back end.\n\n## Live reload\n\nLive reload is a convenient feature to allow to see changes as soon as a file is saved. In our case, that would mean upload the changed files and eventually restart the webapp.  \n\n## Users \u0026 permissions\n\nStudent and teachers are both users. Teachers can host his own project, for demonstration purpose let's say. He can invite students to register in his class, and manage the projects associated.\n\n## Git integration üí°\n\nUse Git as part of the API, as a backup/rollback system.\nEach project would have a repository.\n\n# CLI\n\nA CLI client for all users. A student should be able to deploy his project, retrieve logs (possibly in live), get link. A teacher has the same rights as student, plus managing resources, users, projects.\n\nBecause most users use Windows, the CLI needs to be cross platform.\n\n# Front end\n\nSimple webapp that allow the same thing as CLI, in a more graphical manner. No install, drag and drop zip/archive to deploy. \nNote for the ZIP: mind that code might be at root of the archive, not in a top-level directory.\n\nIt should present live logs, just like CLI.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-09T18:21:30.356464212Z","tags":null},"/project/road-map":{"title":"Road map üó∫Ô∏è","content":"\n\n# Research üîé\n\nThis section treats about everything that needs to be researched before starting to code.\n\n## API \n\nCompare API types, knowing I want to transfer files, and need live-capabilities.\n\n### REST \u0026 JSON\n\nSee [[research/api/json|JSON]] and [[research/api/rest|REST]].\n\n### GraphQL \u0026 JSON\n\n### gRPC \u0026 Protobuf\n\nSee [[research/api/protobuf|Protobuf]].\n\n## Sand-boxing processes \n\nIt's important that each project is isolated from others and eventually from the host.

Messages are defined in a `.proto` file. Let's create a list of people, and see how it's serialised compared to Json.\n\n```protobuf\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\npackage file;\n\nmessage Person {\n    string id = 1;\n    string name = 2;\n    string surname = 3;\n    uint32 age = 4;\n    repeated string hobbies = 5;\n    repeated string allies = 6;\n}\n\nmessage PersonList {\n    repeated Person users = 1;\n}\n```\n\nBefore going further, each property has a identifier (the numbers). They are used in serialisation.\n\nI made a little experiment in JavaScript using [protobufjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs) to compare the length of messages in Json and Protobuf:\n\n```js\nconst protobuf = require(\"protobufjs\");\n\nconst simon = {\n  id: \"12345\",\n  name: \"Simon\",\n  surname: \"Leonard\",\n  age: 21,\n  hobbies: [\"coding\", \"reading\", \"writing\"],\n  allies: [\n    \"54321\",\n  ],\n};\n\nconst lucas = {\n  id: \"54321\",\n  name: \"Lucas\",\n  surname: \"Thomas\",\n  age: 22,\n  hobbies: [],\n  allies: [\n    \"12345\",\n  ],\n};\n\nconst root = protobuf.loadSync(\"file.proto\");\n\nconst Person = root.lookupType(\"file.Person\");\n\nvar simonBuf = Person.create(simon);\nvar lucasBuf = Person.create(lucas);\n\nconst PersonList = root.lookupType(\"file.PersonList\");\nconst users = PersonList.create({ users: [simonBuf, lucasBuf] });\nconst dataUsers = PersonList.encode(users).finish();\n\nconsole.log(\"proto-serialized=\" + dataUsers.length);\nconsole.log(\"json-serialized=\" + JSON.stringify(users).length)\n```\n\nThe score for proto is 93 bytes, and 207 for JSON.\n\nWith a few more line, we can infer what the proto-serialised message look like:\n```js\nconsole.log(dataUsers) // \u003cBuffer 0a 3a 0a 05 31 32 33 34 35 12 05 53 69 6d 6f 6e 1a 07 4c 65 6f 6e 61 72 64 20 15 2a 06 63 6f 64 69 6e 67 2a 07 72 65 61 64 69 6e 67 2a 07 77 72 69 74 ... 43 more bytes\u003e\nconsole.log(dataUser.toString())\n//\n// :\n// 12345SimonLeonard *coding*reading*writing254321\n//\n// 54321LucasThomas 212345\n```","lastmodified":"2023-01-09T18:21:30.356464212Z","tags":null},"/research/api/rest":{"title":"REST","content":"\nREST (*Representational state transfer*) is a style of software architecture that takes advantage of HTTP(S):\n- The path represent a resource\n- A verb represent what kind of operation has to be done\n- Headers are used for various things, like authorisation token\n- The body for the actual data, when needed, nowadays mostly [[research/api/json]] for APIs\n- The return status tells quickly if everything happened as expected\n\nLet's say we have a database of recipe.
