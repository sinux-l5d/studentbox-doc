{"/":{"title":"üë®‚Äçüíª Studentbox documentation","content":"\n_Studentbox_ is a project that aims to make deployment easy for student üë®‚Äçüéì, and management of hosted projects simple for a teacher üë®‚Äçüè´.\n\n# üåç Context\n\nI've realised this project during my BSc (Hons)[^bsc] at [Dundalk Institute of Technology](https://www.dkit.ie/). The curriculum is about _Cloud Computing_, and so this project has to take advantage of different cloud aspects like including scaling, APIs[^api] and automation etc.\n\nSee the [[about-me|About me]] page this know more about the author.\n\n# ü•ú In a nutshell...\n\n_Studentbox_ wants to archive the following goals:\n- Host the students' projects in an isolated environment, without impacting other projects or host system\n- Provide a complete environment for the apps supported\n- Be able to deploy in a single command line...\n\t- PHP app using MySQL\n\t- Node.js app using MongoDB or MySQL\n- The _CLI_[^cli] client should...\n\t- work on Linux, Mac and Windows\n\t- be easy to setup\n\t- be usable by both student and teacher\n- Make possible live-reloading while developing\n\nWhile having the following constraints:\n- Hostable on AWS\n- Self-hostable on an on-premise server\n\n[^bsc]: **B**achelor of **Sc**ience (**Hon**our**s**) is the 4th year after secondary school (in Ireland).\n\tIn France, the equivalent year is the 1st year of Master's degree (the 4th year after _Lyc√©e_).\n[^api]: **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface in IT is an abstraction layer to interact with things we don't want to deal manually with. In this curriculum, we're talking about Web APIs (REST with JSON among others).\n[^cli]: Command Line Interface, as the opposit of Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a text-based interface.\n\tOn Windows, it's in CMD/PowerShell. On Linux, it's in your favourite terminal \u0026 shell (bash, zsh...)
